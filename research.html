               We give a characterization---and in many cases, a new construction---of integral canonical models of Shimura varieties that uses the notion of an aperture appearing in work of the first author with Gardner on some conjectures of Drinfeld. This applies to Shimura varieties of pre-abelian type at primes of hyperspecial level, recovering and extending previous work of Kisin, Kim-Madapusi and Imai-Kato-Youcis, but also to exceptional Shimura varieties for large enough primes. The characterization in the exceptional case is <i>a priori</i> different from the one recently shown by Bakker-Shankar-Tsimerman, and recovers many of their results, such as the existence of prime-to-$p$ Hecke operators and the non-emptiness of the $\mu$-ordinary stratum. In fact, we show the non-emptiness of <i>all</i> possible Newton strata. Under a crystalline good reduction condition that holds when the Shimura datum is of pre-abelian type, we also prove that the syntomic realization map is surjective. An important ingredient in the proofs is a generalization of Tate's full faithfulness theorem for $p$-divisible groups to the context of apertures. This leads to a mapping property for the integral canonical model that characterizes maps into it from all normal, flat and excellent schemes over $\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}$.

                  We use the newly developed stacky prismatic technology of Drinfeld and Bhatt-Lurie to give a uniform, group-theoretic construction of smooth stacks $\mathrm{BT}^{G,\mu}_{n}$ attached to a smooth affine group scheme $G$ over $\mathbb{Z}_p$ and $1$-bounded cocharacter $\mu$, verifying a recent conjecture of Drinfeld. This can be viewed as a refinement of results of B\"ultel-Pappas, who gave a related construction using $(G,\mu)$-displays defined via rings of Witt vectors. We show that, when $G = \mathrm{GL}_h$ and $\mu$ is a minuscule cocharacter, these stacks are isomorphic to the stack of truncated $p$-divisible groups of height $h$ and dimension $d$ (the latter depending on $\mu$). This gives a generalization of results of Ansch\"utz-Le Bras, yielding a linear algebraic classification of $p$-divisible groups over very general $p$-adic bases, and verifying another conjecture of Drinfeld.

The proofs use deformation techniques from derived algebraic geometry, combined with an animated variant of Lau's theory of higher frames and displays, and---with a view towards applications to the study of local and global Shimura varieties---actually prove representability results for a wide range of stacks whose tangent complexes are $1$-bounded in a suitable sense. As an immediate application, we prove algebraicity for the stack of perfect $F$-gauges of Hodge-Tate weights $0,1$ and level $n$.

               We give a new approach to the definition of $p$-isogenies between objects with $\mathcal{G}$-structure via the Vinberg monoid. We combine this work of one of us with Gardner to construct Rapoport-Zink spaces associated with minuscule cocharacters of reductive group schemes over $\mathbb{Z}_p$. We show that these methods also yield a robust theory of Hecke correspondences on integral canonical models of Shimura varieties in the sense of the work of the second author with A. Youcis. This includes those of pre-abelian type and the compact ones of exceptional type. As a consequence, we deduce the existence of formal Igusa stacks and Rapoport-Zink uniformizations for such canonical models. We combine this with arguments of Kisin to show that all mod $p$ isogeny classes on these models admit CM lifts, and we apply this to prove the Langlands-Rapoport-$\tau$ conjecture (as formulated by Kisin-Shin-Zhu) in this context.

           A Shimura variety of Hodge type is a moduli space for abelian varieties equipped with a certain collection of Hodge cycles. We show that the Newton strata on such varieties are nonempty provided that the corresponding group $G$ is quasisplit at $p$, confirming a conjecture of Fargues and Rapoport in this case. Under the same condition, we conjecture that every mod $p$ isogeny class on such a variety contains the reduction of a special point. This is a refinement of Honda–Tate theory. We prove a large part of this conjecture for Shimura varieties of PEL type. Our results make no assumption on the availability of a good integral model for the Shimura variety. In particular, the group $G$ may be ramified at $p$.
