               We give a characterization---and in some cases, a new construction---of integral canonical models of Shimura varieties that uses the notion of an aperture appearing in work of the first author with Gardner on some conjectures of Drinfeld. This applies to Shimura varieties of pre-abelian type at primes of hyperspecial level, recovering and extending previous work of Kisin, Kim--Madapusi and Imai--Kato--Youcis, but also to exceptional Shimura varieties for large enough primes. The characterization in the exceptional case is \emph{a priori} different from the one recently shown by Bakker--Shankar--Tsimerman, and recovers many of their results, such as the existence of prime-to-$p$ Hecke operators, the non-emptiness of the $\mu$-ordinary stratum and the theory of the canonical lift. In fact, we give a uniform proof of the non-emptiness of \emph{all} possible Newton strata, and---in the pre-abelian case---of the non-emptiness of Ekedahl--Oort strata and central leaves as well. An important ingredient in the proofs is a generalization of Tate's full faithfulness theorem for $p$-divisible groups to the context of apertures. This leads to a mapping property for the integral canonical model that characterizes maps into it from all normal, flat and excellent schemes over $\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}$.

                  We show an equivalence of categories, over general $p$-adic bases, between finite locally $p^n$-torsion commutative group schemes and $\mathbb{Z}/p^n\mathbb{Z}$-modules in perfect $F$-gauges of Tor amplitude $[-1,0]$ with Hodge-Tate weights $0,1$. By relating fppf cohomology of group schemes and syntomic cohomology of $F$-gauges, we deduce some consequences: These include the representability of relative fppf cohomology of finite flat group schemes under proper smooth maps of $p$-adic formal schemes, as well as a reproof of a purity result of &Ccaron;esnavi&ccaron;ius-Scholze. We also give a general criterion for a classification in terms of objects closely related to Zink's windows over frames and Lau's divided Dieudonné crystals, and we use this to recover several known classifications, and also give some new ones.

        <h3>An algebraicity conjecture of Drinfeld and the moduli of $p$-divisible groups (joint with Zachary Gardner)</h3>
        <p>Proving certain conjectures of Drinfeld leading to a good definition of stacks of `$p$-divisible groups with $G$-structure' even when this cannot make literal sense. These objects that we have termed <i>apertures</i> are important for a bunch of global applications that will be considered in works in progress.</p>

                  We use the newly developed stacky prismatic technology of Drinfeld and Bhatt-Lurie to give a uniform, group-theoretic construction of smooth stacks $\mathrm{BT}^{G,\mu}_{n}$ attached to a smooth affine group scheme $G$ over $\mathbb{Z}_p$ and $1$-bounded cocharacter $\mu$, verifying a recent conjecture of Drinfeld. This can be viewed as a refinement of results of B\"ultel-Pappas, who gave a related construction using $(G,\mu)$-displays defined via rings of Witt vectors. We show that, when $G = \mathrm{GL}_h$ and $\mu$ is a minuscule cocharacter, these stacks are isomorphic to the stack of truncated $p$-divisible groups of height $h$ and dimension $d$ (the latter depending on $\mu$). This gives a generalization of results of Ansch\"utz-Le Bras, yielding a linear algebraic classification of $p$-divisible groups over very general $p$-adic bases, and verifying another conjecture of Drinfeld.

The proofs use deformation techniques from derived algebraic geometry, combined with an animated variant of Lau's theory of higher frames and displays, and---with a view towards applications to the study of local and global Shimura varieties---actually prove representability results for a wide range of stacks whose tangent complexes are $1$-bounded in a suitable sense. As an immediate application, we prove algebraicity for the stack of perfect $F$-gauges of Hodge-Tate weights $0,1$ and level $n$.

               We give a new approach to the definition of $p$-isogenies between objects with $\mathcal{G}$-structure via the Vinberg monoid. We combine this work of one of us with Gardner to construct Rapoport-Zink spaces associated with minuscule cocharacters of reductive group schemes over $\mathbb{Z}_p$. We show that these methods also yield a robust theory of Hecke correspondences on integral canonical models of Shimura varieties in the sense of the work of the second author with A. Youcis. This includes those of pre-abelian type and the compact ones of exceptional type. As a consequence, we deduce the existence of formal Igusa stacks and Rapoport-Zink uniformizations for such canonical models. We combine this with arguments of Kisin to show that all mod $p$ isogeny classes on these models admit CM lifts, and we apply this to prove the Langlands-Rapoport-$\tau$ conjecture (as formulated by Kisin-Shin-Zhu) in this context.

               We prove a version of Fontaine-Laffaille theory for arbitrary $p$-adic formal schemes. That is, we show that prismatic $F$-gauges over such formal schemes with Hodge-Tate weights in $\{0,\ldots,p-2\}$ can be described in terms of modules over $p$-completed derived de Rham cohomology with additional structure. This generalizes results of Terentiuk-Vologodsky-Xu, who considered the case of the formal scheme $\mathrm{Spf}~W(\kappa)$ for a perfect field $\kappa$. We give applications to the classification of $p$-adic local systems over $p$-adic formal schemes. The proofs use descent to reduce to the case of semiperfect animated commutative $\mathbb{F}_p$-algebras, where we use frame theoretic methods appearing in the work of Gardner-Madapusi. The key computation is that of the syntomic cohomology of $\mathbb{F}_p/{}^{\mathbb{L}}p$.

               I employ methods from derived algebraic geometry to give a uniform moduli-theoretic construction of special cycle classes on integral canonical models of many Shimura varieties of pre-abelian type, including unitary, quaternionic, and orthogonal Shimura varieties, away from primes of bad reduction. All desired properties of these classes, even for those corresponding to degenerate Fourier coefficients under the Kudla correspondence, follow naturally from the construction, which realizes the classes as virtual fundamental classes associated with derived special cycles. Notably, under certain natural conditions, the construction gives a functional on the full space of spherical vectors in the Schwartz space of a Hermitian module, and is therefore amenable to a study under the action of the spherical Hecke algebra. This appears to be new already in the case of modular curves. I formulate Kudla’s modularity conjectures in this general framework, and give some preliminary evidence towards their validity.

               An important ingredient of the construction is provided by recent work with Youcis on a syntomic characterization of integral canonical models.

               Along the way, I also generalize the Tate conjecture for special homomorphisms to situations where the extremal Hodge number is not necessarily one.

           A Shimura variety of Hodge type is a moduli space for abelian varieties equipped with a certain collection of Hodge cycles. We show that the Newton strata on such varieties are nonempty provided that the corresponding group $G$ is quasisplit at $p$, confirming a conjecture of Fargues and Rapoport in this case. Under the same condition, we conjecture that every mod $p$ isogeny class on such a variety contains the reduction of a special point. This is a refinement of Honda–Tate theory. We prove a large part of this conjecture for Shimura varieties of PEL type. Our results make no assumption on the availability of a good integral model for the Shimura variety. In particular, the group $G$ may be ramified at $p$.

We prove a conjecture of Bruinier and Yang, relating the arithmetic intersection multiplicities of special divisors and complex multiplication points on $M$ to the central derivatives of certain $L$-functions.

When $n=1$, the Shimura variety $M$ is a classical quaternionic Shimura curve, and our result is a variant of the Gross–Zagier theorem on heights of Heegner points.

          We show that the classical Kuga–Satake construction gives rise, away from characteristic 2, to an open immersion from the moduli of primitively polarized K3 surfaces (of any fixed degree) to a certain regular integral model for a Shimura variety of orthogonal type. This allows us to attach to every polarized K3 surface in odd characteristic an abelian variety such that divisors on the surface can be identified with certain endomorphisms of the attached abelian variety. In turn, this reduces the Tate conjecture for K3 surfaces over finitely generated fields of odd characteristic to a version of the Tate conjecture for certain endomorphisms on the attached Kuga–Satake abelian variety, which we prove. As a by-product of our methods, we also show that the moduli stack of primitively polarized K3 surfaces of degree $2d$ is quasi-projective and, when d is not divisible by $p^2$, is geometrically irreducible in characteristic $p$. We indicate how the same method applies to prove the Tate conjecture for co-dimension 2 cycles on cubic fourfolds.

           We construct regular integral canonical models for Shimura varieties attached to Spin and orthogonal groups at (possibly ramified) primes $p>2$ where the level is not divisible by $p$. We exhibit these models as schemes of ‘relative PEL type’ over integral canonical models of larger Spin Shimura varieties with good reduction at $p$. Work of Vasiu–-Zink then shows that the classical Kuga–-Satake construction extends over the integral models and that the integral models we construct are canonical in a very precise sense. Our results have applications to the Tate conjecture for K3 surfaces, as well as to Kudla’s program of relating intersection numbers of special cycles on orthogonal Shimura varieties to Fourier coefficients of modular forms.

           We construct toroidal compactifications for integral models of Shimura varieties of Hodge type. We also construct integral models of the minimal (Satake--Baily--Borel) compactification. Our results essentially reduce the problem to understanding the integral models themselves. As such, they cover all previously known cases of PEL type. At primes where the level is hyperspecial, we show that our compactifications are canonical in a precise sense. We also provide a new proof of Y. Morita’s conjecture on the everywhere good reduction of abelian varieties whose Mumford-Tate group is anisotropic modulo center. Along the way, we demonstrate an interesting rationality property of Hodge cycles on abelian varieties with respect to $p$-adic analytic uniformizations.
